# Data Processor with Logging 🌑

This project demonstrates how to track script activities using a professional logging system instead of just printing to the console.

---

### **What it does:**
* **Automatic Logging:** Records every script action into a file named `process.log`.
* **Timestamping:** Includes exact date and time for every event.
* **Process Tracking:** Simulates real-world data automation tasks.

### **How to use:**
1. Ensure `data_processor.py` is in your directory.
2. Run the script: `python data_processor.py`.
3. View logs: Check the results using `cat process.log`.
