Data Processor with Logging
This is a Python project I created while learning DevOps and Python development. The goal of this script is to demonstrate how to track script activities using a professional logging system instead of just printing to the console.
Features
 * Automatic Logging: Records every action into a file named process.log.
 * Timestamping: Every log entry includes the exact date and time the action occurred.
 * Process Tracking: Simulates a data cleaning task to show how real-world automation works.
Project Files
 * data_processor.py: The main script containing the Python logic.
 * process.log: The generated file where all activities are stored.
How to Setup and Run
 * Make sure you have Python installed in your environment (I am using Termux on Android).
 * Run the script using the command:
   python data_processor.py

 * To view the log results, use: cat process.log
